I'm a big fan of teaching people technology.
Especially relatively simple technology that is foundational to modern computer use.
Over the years, I have helped demystify web development for lots of people by doing something very simple:

I built them a single page demo.
Like this [three-column website layout using CSS grid (on gist.github.com)][three-column].

If you check out that Github gist, you'll note that it is commented deeply.
With commentary on best practices, alternative choices, and what each important rules does.

I'm also a fan of the indie web.

<p class="pull-quote">I think people should own their work on the web.</p>

These examples sitting in a gist or some other file share that supports others doesn't sit right with my goals.

One day, when I was asked by more people than I could physically help at once, I realized, these should be a website.

So now they are!

### [Steal This Website][steal]

The philosophy of Steal This Website is founded in the philosophy of the web I grew up with.
It's free and intentionally licensed CC-0, so you can borrow or steal bits of markup and styling as you please.
It's written with a view of the platform as the raw materials of the web.

I would call it "web brutalism" except that term already means something else.

Do me a favor, and share widely.
