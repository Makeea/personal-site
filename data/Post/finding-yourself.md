The following article is important to my personal history. It was published on
the Have A Gay Day tumblr on August 27, 2014. Nowadays, I consider it an
argument I laid before myself to finally realize I was trans. As I do not
control the blog in question, I've decided to archive this important piece of
my history here. What follows is the work as published.

> A common question among those who identify somewhere on the wide canvas of
> gender identity beyond “The parts I was born with say I am” is “how do I know
> what I am?”
> 
> The simple and most true answer is unfortunately also the least helpful:
> 
> You just know.
> 
> Since that’s not helpful, I’ll talk about my own gender identity and the not
> so straight path to getting comfortable with myself.
> 
> I was born a boy, and for around 16 years, that’s all I ever considered. Part
> of that came from growing up in a fairly conservative home, part of it just
> being the type to not care about gender or sexuality.
> 
> Around 17, though, was the first time I was misgendered in a way that WASN’T
> intended to belittle me. A simple “You go, girl” from a friend whom I had
> never discussed my gender with. After explaining myself, and she apologizing,
> profusely, we laughed it off. It wasn’t a big deal, I was secure in myself.
> 
> Around this time, I also got into a fairly permissive version of neopaganism.
> The person I paired with often for magical tasks was a woman, except the
> energies we used and parts we played were opposite our given gender: I was
> the feminine, and she was the masculine.
> 
> Then I started roleplaying as women online. I was incredibly good at this. To
> the point that one community didn’t even suspect I wasn’t a woman at the
> keyboard.
> 
> In addition, over the years, I was often enough called miss or ma’am that it
> became a running joke. I absolutely loved it. Not to humiliate people, but it
> made me feel good when it happened.
> 
> I’m going to break my story here because all of the above? These should have
> been hints. Had I been as involved in the LGBT community then as I am now,
> I’d have known almost immediately. But here I am, and I’ve got ten more years
> until now. So if you think something looks obvious in retrospect, you’re
> probably right. Don’t beat yourself up over it.
> 
> I got married, had a couple of kids, and due to some domestic violence and
> emotional abuse, ended up separating, and eventually divorcing, my ex-wife. I
> ended up playing mom and dad to my kids.
> 
> Over the years following my marriage, I saw a counselor, I went to school, I
> learned to love me for me. And that’s about the time I realized I wasn’t
> comfortable as a man. At all. I didn’t know WHAT I was, but I wasn’t the guy
> I was born and socialized to be. PArt of this realization came from finally
> listening to my transgender friends and realizing how much of their before
> story was familiar. Part of it was learning more about dysphoria. And part of
> it was really coming to terms with things that made me uncomfortable in day
> to day life. Like being lumped in with the guys. For anything.
> 
> Eventually, I started identifying as genderqueer. I KNEW I had feminine days.
> I knew I had more masculine days, and most days I wasn’t sure which was more
> likely.
> 
> I kept that ID for about a year, until very recently in fact, when I
> realized, my “I would rather be a woman” days were actually the rule, and not
> the exception. And so I decided to start looking at a new name, and asked a
> circle of very close friends to call me she/her. And you know what? It felt
> really good.
> 
> I know this is a bit long, and but context is important: I figured out my
> identity because deep down, I knew. But it took a lot of self education, some
> experimentation, and some time to heal from the hurt I suffered to really
> understand it.
> 
> TL;DR:
> 
> * Educate yourself. Knowing what’s out there, and what others going through
>   it have felt will help!
> * Experiment. You don’t have to be afraid to try on pronouns for a day or a
>   week or a month. Try a nickname of your desired gender. Don’t worry, it’s
>   normal!
> * Reflect. Hard to believe, but people in general are REALLY bad at self
>   reflection. Take some time for yourself, think about it.
> * Get help. Get a support structure, don’t be afraid of medical
>   professionals, and know everything is easier when you’re healthy. (Don’t
>   worry about putting it off until you’re healthy though!)
>
> PS:
> 
> This is actually the first time I’ve publicly announced myself as a woman.
> So, hi everyone, she/her pronouns, if you please.
