Recently, I condensed a fairly large idea down to a tweet. I attempt to do this regularly, but rarely does such an
exercise leave a an artifact I am proud of. It's an idea that's been percolating in an environment where the discussion
about what counts as politics in software has become more and more tense. As the Ethical Source movement started
growing. Most importantly, it was being developed in tandem with my project ppb and it's shift from my project to a
project that is both principles and community driven.

The tweet was this one:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Your software only matters where it intersects with people. You should care how it&#39;s used and how it affects those people.</p>&mdash; PyPer Thunstrom (@pathunstrom) <a href="https://twitter.com/pathunstrom/status/1276821636415709184?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 27, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

It is my firmly held belief that software is for people. It matters most where it makes people's lives better. Software
has the power to lift up everyone and unlock so much creativity among everyone. We, the software developers, have the
power to help it reach that lofty goal. I think we have something of a moral imperative to reach that goal.

## Principles Driven Development

I gave my first talk at PyCon this year, via invite to the vitual Education Summit where I got to dig deep into the
process of recognizing that principles are how projects like ppb decide what matters and where to put their effort. It
also included the process of finding those principles and condensing them into an artifact to share with others.


Things I want to cover:

* Ethical source movement
* All software has UX
