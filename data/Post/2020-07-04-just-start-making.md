Those who follow me know that I don't tend to describe myself as a game
developer, I like the phrase "game enthusiast". I do a lot of
[game dev](https://ppb.dev), but I also play a lot of games,
[talk about games](https://youtu.be/bbKED0o3uVU), and read about games.

If you want to be a game designer or game developer, you should be doing this
too. After all, games are a craft and art form just like any other creative
endeavor and the best way to learn is to keep working on it. So if you want to
be a designer, you should start learning your craft.

The most common kind of game designer I know of is RPG facilitators (DM, GM,
Host, whatever flavor your RPG has). These are people who take an existing
toolbox and try to design experiences for a fixed set of players. If you've ever
run a tabletop RPG, you've already experienced the task of game design.

From facilitating, a common next step for folks is building their own RPG
setting. The amount of folks I know who have been working on the same setting
for years (and sometimes decades!). I want to say as a person with a long
history of perfectionism:

You're hurting yourself, put that aside for a bit and build smaller games.

### Make Games

If you want to stick to RPGs: Build dynamic encounters that evoke the feeling
you want in your setting. Write self contained adventures that explore the
themes you're interested in. Design monsters and races and introduce them to
your running games, or friends games!

**Don't stop at RPGs!**

Try building board games. If you know how to code, try video games. Experiment
with design space, try building a new game for a standard deck of playing cards.
Experiment with challenges like the
[10 Minute Design Challenge](http://10minutedesignchallenge.co.uk/).

### Play Games

Another thing you should do is play a wider variety of games. If you only play
D&D, try some of the other RPGs out there. If you've never played a table top
RPG, you should really give them a chance.
(I like [Fate](https://www.evilhat.com/home/fate-core/))

Play board games, and not just the kind you like, try some of the stuff you
don't like. I don't like party games in general, but I keep trying new ones.
Every now and then, you find a clever mechanic or theme that can help you make
better games.

Try video games, too. Again, even things you don't like.

The important thing is that just like a writer needs to read broadly, a game
developer or designer should experience a wide variety of games.

### Study

Lastly, study the theory around games. There's fabulous books out there to help
you with this: things like _The Rules of Play_ or _A Theory of Fun_ (both in my
"to be read" pile.) There's youtube channels and podcasts, and hundreds of tiny
communities of game designers where you can talk with other folks.

Games have their own language and society de-emphasizes game literacy as a skill
that is important. You'll want to counteract that de-emphasis in your own
studies.

Don't stop at games, though! Learn a craft, practice an art, try a new skill
set, watch movies, read books, study visual design. All creative fields have a
tendency to become insular, and games are no different. Instead of always
draining your inspiration making new stuff, try learning or experiencing
something new! That'll fill you up to try new things.

If you've been designing that perfect game for a handful of years, it's time to
put it aside and go make some other games. Come back with a fresh set of eyes
and more tools in your toolbox. You'll thank yourself.
