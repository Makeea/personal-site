# Professional Background

During the day, I'm a web developer, about as full-stack as I can be. I
was part of the team in charge of deploys at one job, where we mostly
hadn't heard of devops so did a lot of manual ec2 management. I've lived
both SQL and noSQL with and without an ORM. Written API services in
multiple flavors of Python, Go, and Javascript. Written both great and
terrible front end with everything from hand tuned HTML and CSS through
to react.

I'm a writer with separate backgrounds in fiction and non-fiction. I quit
fiction a long time ago for my health, but still do a lot of technical and
creative non-fiction writing. I also edit and do technical vetting, with
many projects being in CS education, like
[Code This Game](https://www.odddot.com/codethisgame) published with
MacMillan's Odd Dot imprint.

# Software

My most important project is [ppb](https://ppb.dev).
It combines my passion for learning and teaching with game development,
which is where I learned my stuff. I also make available source and open
source games.

# Speaking

I primarily speak at regional Python user groups and Python conferences,
and am always open to making an appearance. I've given lots of talks on
games and my software work. I also talk about being trans in tech and
mental health. Every now and then I even talk about my failures.
