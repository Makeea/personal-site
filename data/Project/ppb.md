PursuedPyBear started as a way to speed up development for myself, but as I
began demoing it to educators, got asked if I could make it classroom friendly.
That started the long road to its current form.

ppb as a project seeks to reduce the complexity around games while remaining
code first and open to extension and modification. It's audience includes
students, hobbyist game developers, teachers, and professional game developers.
